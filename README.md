# GeminiDesktop

A simple implementation of gemini for your desktop.

You can wake the ai with any sentence that has the word gemini in it.
Or by saying you have a question in whatever way you like.

## Features:
 - Wake word activation
 - Screen sharing to AI
 - Last 15 seconds of destkop video sent to ai on activation
 - Instead of live video, you can turn it of and the ai will only send a new screenshot when you speak more infrequently to give ai context without continuous streaming.
 - AI can use code to help.
 - AI can use search.
 - Alt + Q to wake up the ai.
